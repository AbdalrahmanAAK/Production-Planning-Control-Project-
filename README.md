## Introduction 
<div align="justify"> 
Forecasting is an important tool in the modern world if a company fails in forecasting its product or services there might be a huge risk and consequences, the meaning of forecasting is predecting a future event.The Al Hassan Ghazi Ibrahim Shaker Company has a long and illustrious history that spans over 70 years. Despite the challenges of the business landscape, the company has managed to thrive and become the exclusive agent for LG air conditioners in Saudi Arabia, a highly prestigious achievement.
however they have two types of warehouses first is for fully functional devices that is ready to be sell and second one is for spare parts, there has been a huge problem that occuar in the spare parts warehouses that is the stacking of unncessery items which lead to a shutdown, hence the importance of the company's forecasting methods, examining how these methods contribute to informed decision-making processes. </div> 

## Objective 
<div align="justify"> After Observing the system inside the warehouse it was noticable that the spare parts consists of three type small, medium and large. The main object is to determine the right forecast technique for each part </div>

## Methodology 
<div align="justify"> Al Hassan Ghazi Ibrahim Shaker Company faced some challenges throughout the years to determine the right forecast method, as this case study where performed to make a decision, the past year data were used to perform this case study as the data were classified into three types, large, medium and small, the quantitative forecast were used, three forecast method were considered as it will be mention below, and three model performance were used to compare the validity of the forecast method which is mean absolute deviation (MAD), mean squared error (MSE) and mean absolute squared error (MAPE). </div>
<div align="justify"> As fore the forecast methods Naive, Moving averages and Exponential smoothing was put in consideration, each one of them contain its advantage Naive method is simple and no calculation is required  as for moving averages it put some recent data in consider lastly the exponential smoothing it helps in predecting the trend make it best choice for cyclical products. Measure of accuracy helps in determining the right forecast method the lower the value the best.  </div>

## Results 
After performing the forecast method for each part and calculating the measure of accuracy the following results is as shown in below table.

## Recommendation 
<div align="justify"> After conducting the calculation and performing the measure of forecast accuracy itâ€™s possible to determine the right forecasting method for each the large, medium, and small spare part. Judging by the performance accuracy of the forecast (MAD, MSE, MAPE). It is highly recommended for the large parts to use the moving averages forecast methods, as for the medium and small parts its recommended to use the exponential forecast, thus these results is based on the lower summation of (MAD,MSE,MAPE), it is logically for the medium and small parts to use these type of forecast because the exponential forecasting put the previous actual value and the past forecasted value and give each one of them a specified weight. </div>

## Conclusion 
<div align="justify">After visiting the shaker group and perform the forecast for the three parts, there are some interesting information that to be mentioned they have two kind of storages one for full devices that they directly sells, and the other for the spare parts, the study was conducted in the second type of storages, there is some storages they had to shut down due to high cost and stack for some unnecessary parts, as in this study it refined recommendations as a result of this first-hand experience and further optimized the strategic use of forecasting methods tailored to the air conditioning and home appliances industries. </div>
